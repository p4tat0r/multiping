# multiping

Just for a friend, a small challenge before the 31st of january 2023 (started in september 2022)  
He wants to become a dev, and I challenged him to write 1 script with these specs :  
  
"I give you 10 sites, you ping them, sort them by latency and display them ordered.  
You can use any language and I don't care about how ugly is the output, as long as you can read and they are sorted."  
  
  
So in the same vein as [FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition), I decided to write this script in as many languages as I could.  
You are welcome to participate, adding the script in a language that's not here.
